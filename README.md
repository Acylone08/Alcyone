# A Spectacular Blog on High Level Physics by ALCY-1 
I am a hard working, loyal and dedicated fellow with a passion for literature. For about 7 years, I worked as a freelancer, through platforms like Elance (later UP Work), where I wrote a variety of materials, ranging from quantum physics college papers to romantic novels. I am one of the early adopters of Bitcoin and I have followed the crypto industry for almost a decade. Recently, I have decided to get out of anonymity and I started collaborating with cryptocurrency based platforms such as Coin Info News, where I write reviews about Blockchain projects that are currently undergoing ICO. I also started my own blog, where I cover multiple topics: interviews, reviews, tutorials, trading analysis, Founder at Blockchain &amp; Cryptocurrency Development Hub and Founder at Academia Luminis, ghost writer, Market Speculator, invested in neuralink and other technologies aiding health, qualified mechatronics engineer apprentice.
